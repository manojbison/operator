# Openshift TektonCD operator

This repository holds Openshift's fork of
[`tektoncd/operator`](https://github.com/tektoncd/operator) with additions and
fixes needed only for the OpenShift side of things.

## Creating a Release branch

1. Set the following environment variables

  ```bash
  export OPERATOR_UPSTREAM_BRANCH=release-v0.50.x
  export OPERATOR_MIDSTREAM_BRANCH=release-v0.50.x
  export PIPELINE_VERSION=v0.28.3
  export TRIGGERS_VERSION=v0.16.1
  export CATALOG_RELEASE_BRANCH=release-v0.28
  ```

1. Run `create-release-branch` script

  ```bash
  ./openshift/release/create-release-branch.sh
  ```

### Creating Tags

1. each time we make a release (pathc or minor release) on a `release-vn.n.x` branch merge the necessary pull-requests (cherry picks)
   then tag the commit and push the tag to `github.com/openshift/tektoncd-operator`.

   **eg:**

  ```bash
   git tag v0.50.0 <commit sha>
   git push openshift c0.50.0
  ```

## How this repository works ?

The `master` branch holds up-to-date specific [openshift files](./openshift)
that are necessary for CI setups and maintaining it. This includes:

- Scripts to create a new release branch from `upstream`
- CI setup files
  - tests scripts

Each release branch holds the upstream code for that release and our
openshift's specific files.

## CI Setup

For the CI setup, two repositories are of importance:

- This repository
- [openshift/release](https://github.com/openshift/release) which
  contains the configuration of CI jobs that are run on this
  repository

All of the following is based on OpenShiftâ€™s CI operator
configs. General understanding of that mechanism is assumed in the
following documentation.
